<h1>CA Tunneling with CAXY and SSH</h1>

<p>Till Straumann &lt;<a
href="mailto:strauman@slac.stanford.edu">strauman@slac.stanford.edu</a>&gt;,
6/2012. </p>

<p><em><strong>caxy</strong></em> is now also available as an implementation in
java. This means that you don't have to compile anything but you can use the
pre-compiled application on any platform supporting java (&gt;= 1.5; 1.6
required for auto_address_list support). </p>

<h2><a name="section_2" id="section_2">Intr</a><a name="section_21"
id="section_21">oduction</a></h2>

<p>The CA protocol uses both, TCP and UDP messages. While it is easy to tunnel
the former using the powerful port-forwarding features of <a
href="http://www.openssh.org/">SSH</a> it is not straightforward to tunnel UDP
messages. </p>

<p>This document explains how to set up a TCP tunnel and documents the
<strong><em>caxy</em></strong> proxy software that encapsulates (and modifies)
CA-UDP messages for tunneling them via TCP. </p>
<hr />

<h2><a name="section_3">Quick Instructions for the Impatient</a></h2>

<h3>Terminology </h3>
<dl>
  <dt>insidehost</dt>
    <dd>ssh-reachable machine on CA network
      ("<em><strong>inside</strong></em>"); has direct connectivity to
    IOCs.</dd>
  <dt>outsidehost</dt>
    <dd>'laptop' out on the internet ("<strong><em>outside</em></strong>").
      Wishes to reach CA network via a secure tunnel. </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>java 1.6 (can also be built to work with 1.5) on both: inside + outside.
  </li>
  <li>caxy.jar on both, inside + outside. </li>
  <li>patched EPICS CA libraries OR proxyfier software (e.g., <em>tsocks</em>
    OR <em>dante</em> - linux, <em>proxycap</em> - windows). Needed on outside
    only. </li>
  <li>ssh client (<em><a href="http://www.openssh.org/">openssh</a></em> -
    linux, bsd, osx, <a
    href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"><em>putty</em></a>
    - windows). Needed on the outside only.</li>
  <li>ssh server. Needed on the inside only.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Launch Tunnel </h3>

<p>On outside machine issue (in command line window): </p>
<dl>
  <dt>LINUX</dt>
    <dd><pre><code>  java -jar caxy.jar -- ssh -D1080 user@insidehost java -jar caxy.jar -I </code></pre>
    </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>WINDOWS</dt>
    <dd><p>Using <em>PUTTY</em>; we assume a complete configuration 'inside'
      has already been created and saved under the name 'inside'. We also
      assume authentication has been resolved either using GSSAPI or public key
      files etc. As a last resort, you'd have to append a <code>-pw
      &lt;password_in_clear&gt;</code> option to the plink command here: </p>
      <p></p>
      <pre><code>  java -jar caxy.jar -- plink inside java -jar caxy.jar -I</code></pre>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>Once the tunnel is up, the message '<em>CAXY -- tunnel now established</em>'
appears. The tunnel remains running in the shell's 'foreground' and you can
take it down by hitting &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; to kill it (and a few ugly error
messages appear). </p>

<h3>2. Tell CA library to Use Tunnel </h3>

<p>You have to tell CA clients to use the tunnel by</p>
<dl>
  <dt>either</dt>
    <dd><p>using a PATCHED EPICS CA library and setting:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><pre><code>  export EPICS_SOCKS_PROXY=localhost</code></pre>
      </p>
    </dd>
  <dt>or</dt>
    <dd><p>proxify current session (e.g., for DANTE -- note that the config
      file has to be set up beforehand; consult DANTE docs)</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><pre><code>  . socksify</code></pre>
      </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>3. Use CA Clients Normally </h3>

<p>Now you can use CA clients normally: </p>
<pre><code>  caget my_PV</code></pre>

<p></p>

<h1><a name="section_3_1">DETAILED DOCUMENATION OF INNER WORKINGS AND
USE</a></h1>

<h2><a name="section_4">TCP Tunnel</a></h2>

<p>The most flexible way for tunneling CA TCP connections is using ssh's <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS">SOCKS</a> proxy implementation
together with a SOCKS wrapper implementation (a so-called <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_proxifiers">proxifier</a></em>)
like <em><a href="http://tsocks.sourceforge.net/">tsocks</a></em> or <em><a
href="http://www.inet.no/dante/">dante</a></em> (client) or alternatively:
patched versions of the EPICS CA client libraries (C/C++ or java,
respectively). The patches which implement native SOCKS support for EPICS-CA
have been submitted to the maintainers but are not yet present in the current
releases of EPICS base or CAJ. Using these patches obsoletes the need for a
proxifier. </p>

<p>Assume we have two hosts 'inside' and 'outside'. 'inside' is directly
connected to the CA network, i.e., it can directly communicate with EPICS IOCs,
receives their CA search replies, beacons etc. </p>

<p>The 'outside' host may only connect to the CA network via ssh. </p>

<p>On the 'outside' machine execute </p>
<pre><code>  ssh -D 1080 user@inside</code></pre>

<p>This sets up a SOCKS proxy on the standard port 1080. The ssh proxy - in
combination with the SOCKS-patch for EPICS or (alternatively) a so called
'proxifier' wrapper library - can transparently tunnel TCP connections. E.g.,
if you issue </p>
<pre><code>  tsocks telnet another_inside_machine</code></pre>

<p>Then you can transparently telnet over ssh and here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>tsocks</em> library intercepts the
    'connect(another_inside_machine:23)' system call and connects to the proxy
    host instead (e.g., 'localhost:1080').</li>
  <li><em>tsocks</em> library negotiates with SOCKS proxy (1080 port on
    localhost talks over encrypted channel with sshd on 'inside') to create a
    connection to 'another_inside_machine:23'. </li>
  <li><em>sshd</em> creates a new (<em>not encrypted</em>) connection from
    'inside' to 'another_inside_machine:23' and forwards all further traffic
    going through the intercepted connection (steps 1+2) to/from this new one.
  </li>
  <li><em>tsocks</em> library returns from 'connect' with the user's socket now
    apparently connected to 'another_inside_machine:23' (via
    'proxy_host:proxy_port'). </li>
  <li>user/client talks to socket as if a direct connection existed. </li>
</ol>

<p>Consult <em>tsocks</em> or <em>dante</em> documentation for how to set up
those packages (it is really easy; just have to define routes that use the
proxy instead of trying to establish direct connections). </p>

<h3>Native SOCKS Support for EPICS </h3>

<p>A patch '<code>base-&lt;vers&gt;-socks-proxy.diff'</code> to EPICS-base is
available which adds SOCKS support to EPICS. This means that you can execute CA
clients without the need for proxifier software (free versions of such software
seems hard to come by under windows). You also don't have to worry about
learning how to set up the proxifier. <code></code></p>

<p>The patch adds a new function '<code>epicsConnectViaProxy()</code>' which is
a plug-in replacement for '<code>connect()</code>' but knows how to negotiate
with a SOCKS proxy server when establishing a connection. </p>

<p>The patch also replaces the call to '<code>connect()</code>' in the CA
client library with a call to <code>epicsConnectViaProxy()</code>. </p>

<p>You can define a proxy by setting the environment variable
'<code>EPICS_SOCKS_PROXY</code>' to point to your proxy server. If you use an
<em>ssh</em> tunnel with 'dynamic port forwarding' then the <em>ssh</em> client
(running on your machine) is the SOCKS proxy server. Hence you just need to </p>
<pre><code>  export EPICS_SOCKS_PROXY=localhost</code></pre>

<p>and you're done. Easy enough, isn't it? If the
<code>EPICS_SOCKS_PROXY</code> variable is not defined then
<code>epicsConnectViaProxy()</code> behaves just like an ordinary
'<code>connect()</code>', i.e., a direct connection to the target is
established. </p>

<p>Note: If your CA libraries are dynamic libraries then you <em>dont</em> have
to rebuild all your CA applications! Just patch EPICS base and rebuild base.
Nothing in the API that would compromise binary compatibility is changed by
this patch. </p>

<p>A analogous patch is available for the CAJ native java implementation of CA.
Consult the <a href="#section_7_1_1_1">section about CAJ and CSS</a> below. </p>

<h2><a name="section_5">UDP Tunnel</a></h2>

<p>This is trickier. While SOCKS-5 does define support for the UDP protocol
this is not implemented by <em>ssh</em>. Hence, tunneling CA-UDP does not work
out of the box. </p>

<p>An alternative to the '<strong><em>caxy</em></strong>' program would have
been a more generic proxy that handles SOCKS-5/UDP and tunnels the UDP frames
via TCP/SSH. However, SOCKS-5/UDP only supports UDP 'connections' that
originate at the SOCKS client (i.e., frames being sent to a peer and the peer
repeating back to the sender/client). Hence, even with SOCKS-5/UDP it would not
be possible to relay CA beacons which originate at EPICS IOCs. </p>

<p>This is where the '<strong><em>caxy</em></strong>' program comes in. This
program wraps CA-UDP messages and ships them through a dedicated TCP tunnel
(which is set up in the usual way with <em>ssh</em>). </p>

<p>The same program is executed (with different flags) on the 'inside' and
'outside' machines, respectively. </p>

<h3>'<strong><em>caxy</em></strong>' on 'outside' machine:<br />
</h3>

<p>A UDP socket on port <code>CA_SERVER_PORT</code> (overrideable with the
<code>EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT</code> env-var) listens for incoming CA packets. The
packet is then written to a TCP connection along with wrapping information that
identifies the sender of the packet.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram:</p>

<hr />

<h3>'caxy -I' on 'Inside' Machine<br />
</h3>

<p>receives wrapped UDP messages from TCP tunnel, unwraps and sends to all IOCs
listed in <code>EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST</code> (as defined for caxy running
'inside'). </p>

<p>For each 'sender' (in the outside world) the 'inside'
<strong><em>caxy</em></strong> program maintains a UDP socket as a proxy so
that replies arriving at that socket can be sent back (via the TCP tunnel) to
the 'sender' of a request on the 'outside'. </p>

<p>When UDP messages arrive at a proxy socket then 'inside' retrieves the
'sender' address information from a trivial 'database', wraps the UDP message
together with this info and stuffs it into the TCP tunnel. </p>

<h3>'Outside' Machine<br />
</h3>

<p>receives encapsulated UDP message, unwraps, retrieves 'sender' address and
sends back to 'sender'. </p>

<h2>CA SEARCH REPLY Hack </h2>

<p>The CA protocol (since V48) support a feature where the IOC sending a search
reply embeds its own address into the reply message. If this embedded address
is undefined then the CA client assumes the sender of the reply <em>is</em> the
IOC. Obviously, this would not work with this type of proxy (w/o resorting to
tricks that intercept system calls). Therefore, <strong><em>caxy</em></strong>
ensures that the server address is always embedded into search replies. Note
that <strong><em>caxy</em></strong> does not work with very old (pre-V48) IOCs
and/or clients. </p>

<h2>Beacons</h2>

<p>In a simliar way, CA repeater traffic is proxied and tunneled. The 'inside'
<strong><em>caxy</em></strong> program registers with a <code>caRepeater</code>
that must be running on the 'inside' machine (<strong><em>caxy</em></strong>
does not attempt to launch a repeater).<br />
Any traffic received from the 'inside' repeater is forwarded to the outside and
sent to the repeater port on the outside machine (if a <code>caRepeater</code>
is running on the outside machine then all subscribed clients will receive
beacons). Likewise, the `outside' <strong><em>caxy</em></strong> does not
attempt to start a repeater nor check if one is running. </p>

<p>Properties are first looked up in the user properties file (path itself
defined by JCA property 'gov.aps.jca.JCALibrary.properties' or if such a
property is not found then '.JCALibrary/JCALibrary.properties' in the user's

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The server and repeater port definitions may differ
on the inside and outside. The tunnel handles this transparently but the
settings must of course be correct. I.e., the values for
<strong><em>caxy</em></strong> on the 'outside' must match the settings for CA
clients and outside caRepeater and the values for
<strong><em>caxy</em></strong> on the 'inside' must match the settings for CA
servers and caRepeater on the 'inside'. </p>

<p>This feature is quite useful if the 'inside' CA network uses non-standard
ports. It is only necessary to communicate these non-standard settings to
<strong><em>caxy</em></strong> on the 'inside' (e.g, via a acript that sets the
relevant environment variables or java property files). On the 'outside',
<strong><em>caxy</em></strong> and the CA-clients do not have to replicate the
non-standard settings but may just use the default ones.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Simple Example: </h3>
<pre># Start up a tunnel using STDIO to communicate with the inside:

  java -jar caxy.jar -- ssh -D1080 user@insidehost java -jar caxy.jar -I

# Use PATCHED version of EPICS base;

  export EPICS_SOCKS_PROXY=localhost

  caget some_PV

  edm -x some_edm_screen</pre>

<h3>Example using non-patched EPICS base (with DANTE proxifier under linux)
</h3>
<pre># Start up the tunnel as in the example above

  java -jar caxy.jar -- ssh -D1080 user@insidehost java -jar caxy.jar -I

# from now on all programs are 'socksified'
  . socksify
  caget some_PV

# corresponding dante.conf routes (only 'from' lines):
# all tcp connections to a.b.c.0/24
      from: 0.0.0.0/0 to: a.b.c.0/24 via: 127.0.0.1 port = 1080
      ...</pre>

<h3>caxy TCP can also be tunneled explicitly via ssh: </h3>
<pre># Assume: CA on a.b.c.255 subnet uses port 5066
# We use port 5056 for caxy's tunnel instead of STDIO
# (assume inside has a script 'caxy' which starts up caxy.jar)

  ssh -t -D 1080 -L 5056:localhost:5056 user@insidehost caxy -I -p5056 -a a.b.c.255:5066

# caxy on outside is <em>not</em> socksified but CA clients are:

  java -jar caxy.jar -p 5056 &amp;

  . socksify
  caget some_PV

</pre>

<h3>caxy TCP using a SOCKS tunnel</h3>
<pre># Same as previous example but caxy's tunnel uses the SOCKS proxy, too

  ssh -t -D 1080 user@insidehost java -jar caxy.jar -I -p5056 -a a.b.c.255:5066

# caxy on outside does use SOCKS; CA clients are proxified

  java -DsocksProxyHost=localhost caxy.jar -p 5056 &amp;
  . socksify
  caget some_PV</pre>

<h3>multihop tunnel to 'inside' via 'hop': </h3>
<pre># Note that anyone on 'hop' can possibly use the SOCKS proxy to 'inside'
# If this is a problem then a more sophisticated, encrypted tunnel
# must be set up. Also (and in the above examples alike), anyone
# on 'outside' can use the proxy port 1080.

  java -jar caxy.jar -- \
                     ssh -L 1080:localhost:1080 hophost \
                     ssh -D 1080 insidehost \
                     java -jar caxy.jar -I -a a.b.c.255

# More importantly, this only works for ONE user on 'hop'. A second user
# would find 1080 already in use and would have to use a different 
# port on 'hop', e.g., 3333:

  java -jar caxy.jar -- \
                     ssh -L 1080:localhost:3333 hophost \
                     ssh -tt -D 3333 insidehost \
                     java -jar caxy.jar -I -a a.b.c.255

# use socksified CA client

  . socksify
  caget some_PV

# a better approach to set up a multihop tunnel is using ssh's
# 'ProxyCommand'. This avoids any intermediate port on the 
# gateway/'hop' machine. It is more convenient to set this
# up in the 'config' file.
# The example uses command line options just to illustrate
# the setup:

  java -jar caxy.jar -- \
                     ssh -D 1080 -o 'ProxyCommand=ssh hophost \
                     /usr/bin/nc %h %p' insidehost \
                     java -jar caxy.jar -I -a a.b.c.255</pre>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<pre># Under windows, caxy works perfectly, e.g., in combination with the
# PUTTY ssh client.
# Especially for a multi-hop setup you would want to set up a configuration
# (e.g., 'inside') which you then call up from the command line (plink).

  java -jar caxy.jar -- plink inside java -jar caxy.jar -I</pre>

<h2><a name="section_7_1_1_1" id="section_7_1_1_1">CAJ and CSS</a></h2>

<p>It is possible to tunnel CA for client <a name="applicatio"
id="applicatio">applications</a> which use the 'CAJ' java implementation of the
CA protocol such as the CSS suite. </p>

<p>The <strong><em>caxy</em></strong> tunnel must be started exactly in the
same way as described above. </p>

<p>However, 'proxify-ing' the JVM may or may not work on different platforms.
Therefore, we recommend a different approach: </p>

<p>Some network-related java classes already support connections via a SOCKS
proxy. Hence, this built-in support can be leveraged. When setting the system
property 'socksProxyHost' then all TCP connections established by 'Socket'
objects are transparently going through the proxy. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the 'SocketChannel' class which is used by CAJ (version
1.1.7) completely ignores this built-in support. </p>

<p>A patch to CAJ has been developed (and submitted to the CAJ maintainers, so
it will hopefully be incorporated into future CAJ releases) which adds the
necessary support for SOCKS. (Consult the 'ProxiedSocketChannel.java' file for
more detail.) With this modified CAJ (and the tunnel set up as described in the
previous sections) you could e.g., launch an application as follows: </p>

<p>java -DsocksProxyHost=localhost someCAJApp myPV </p>

<p>The patch to CAJ serves the same purpose (but targeting the java
implementation of CA) as the 'base-&lt;vers&gt;-socks-proxy.diff' to the C/C++
version of EPICS base. </p>

<h3><a name="section_7_1_1_2" id="section_7_1_1_2">Eclipse/CSS</a></h3>

<p>Eclipse also has built-in support for SOCKS proxies (you can define a proxy
under Preferences-General-Network_Connections) but out of the box this does not
interplay with (patched) CAJ or the java built-in SOCKS support in the Socket
class. </p>

<p>Luckily it is just a matter of installing a small plugin to glue these
pieces together. Hence, you need the following ingredients: </p>
<ul>
  <li>obtain or build patched CAJ </li>
  <li>make sure eclipse/CSS uses the patched CAJ (e.g., by installing over the
    vanilla CAJ that comes with CSS) </li>
  <li>install 'org.eclipse.scout.net' plugin for eclipse </li>
</ul>

<p>Now you are able to tunnel your CA connections: </p>
<ul>
  <li>start ssh tunnel and caxy as described above (make sure ssh is started
    with the '-D 1080' option). </li>
  <li>define SOCKS proxy 'localhost:1080' in eclipse/CSS
    Preferences-General-Network_Connections </li>
</ul>

<p>It is worthwhile noting that the patched CAJ as well as eclipse with the
'org.eclipse.scout.net' plugin continue working normally when not told to use a
proxy (e.g., when you plug your laptop into an 'inside' network). You only must
remember to disable the proxy in the 'Network_Connection' settings and/or
remove the 'socksProxyHost' system property. </p>

<h2><a name="section_7_1_1_3" id="section_7_1_1_3">CAS - Channel Access
Security Issues</a></h2>

<p>If CAS is enabled and configured on an IOC then you may be denied access to
a PV. Note that some CA clients produce no warning or error, the PV just seems
to be unreachable or unwriteable. </p>

<p>To understand the issue here it is necessary to know that CAS authentication
is based on a 'user name' and a 'host name'. These names are retrieved on the
machine where the CA client is running and transmitted to the IOC 'inside' the
CA protocol. Hence, it is irrelevant from which machine the CA/TCP connection
originates (the IOC could also check that but it doesn't) which in our case
would be the 'inside' machine (which probably is 'allowed' by CAS rules). </p>

<p>An example: When you are logged into your laptop 'mymachine' as 'Bob' then
these credentials ('Bob/mymachine') are transferred by the CA protocol and will
be checked by the IOC against its CAS rules. </p>

<p>Therefore, you must convince the IOC administrator(s) to add your
name/machine to these rules. </p>

<h2><a name="section_8" id="section_8">CATUN Protocol Versions</a></h2>

<p>'CATUN' is the (trivial) protocol <strong><em>caxy</em></strong> uses to
wrap UDP datagrams for transmission over a stream. The first version of this
tunnel protocol wrapped each individual CA message before shipping it through
the stream/TCP connection. On the receiving end of the serialized stream, each
CA message would be unwrapped and sent out in a UDP datagram. This means that
even though the CA client might have packed multiple CA messages into a single
UDP datagram, once this datagram was shipped through the tunnel (using the
CATUN V1 protocol) it was broken up into multiple packets, each one holding
only a single CA message. </p>

<p>CATUN protocol V2 remedies this and wraps an entire UDP datagram so that the
original packet structure is preserved. </p>

<p>Note that the java version of caxy ONLY support protocol version 2. Hence it
is not possible to co-operate with older versions of the C implementation.</p>

<p>CATUN protocol V3 defines a small albeit not backwards compatible addition
to the initial handshake procedure which enables the outside to detect that the
the tunnel has been established.</p>

<h2>Building/Hacking CAXY</h2>

<p>If you want to mess around with the source code or simply rebuild
<strong>caxy</strong> (e.g., for running under java-1.5) then you need</p>
<ul>
  <li>JDK &gt;= 1.5 (1.6 and later recommended, at least on the 'inside'; the
    'auto_addr_list' feature requires at least 1.6)</li>
  <li>Apache 'ant' - this is the 'build' tool (you want a reasonably recent
    version).</li>
  <li>Source distribution of <strong>caxy</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Change directory to where '<code>build.xml</code>' resides and issue
'<code>ant</code>'</p>
